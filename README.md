# Microsoft-Message-Bridge
A messaging bridge that transforms messages and connects different real time interfaces such as service bus and event hub.
Common uses may be cleaning or transforming incoming JSON data before pushing down stream to another hub, bus or webapi
We have used Microsoft Message Bridge to connect streams to signalR sites to drive data visualization experiences.  In other cases we have used Microsoft Message Bridge as a point to intercept the stream and cache a subset of entities and attributes in Redis.
